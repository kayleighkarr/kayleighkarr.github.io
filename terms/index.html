<h3>Governing Law</h3>

<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of European Union, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
